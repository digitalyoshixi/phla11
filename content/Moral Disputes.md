A disagreement involving moral claims
# Explanantions
### [[Cognitivism]]
Both sides believe claims are [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]], they just don't agree on what [[Moral Facts]] are true and what facts are false
### [[Non-Cognitivism]]
Each side is revealing their own preferences. 
It is actually an opinion disagreement rather than a fact disagreement.
