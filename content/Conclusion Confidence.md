For a given [[Argument]] with conclusion $\neg Q$ and premises $A,B,C$. If you believe in $A,B,C$ and $Q$ (meaning you disagree with the argument's conclusion). 
You can reject the argument by saying with certainty that $Q$ is true, therefore there must be a logical incompatability with $Q$ and one of the premises $A,B,C$.

It doesn't matter if you still believe in $A,B,C$ and $Q$, all that matters is that you value $Q$ more than one of the premises.
**This is how you can disprove an [[Implausibility|Implausible]] argument in which you believe in the premises, but not the conlusion**
