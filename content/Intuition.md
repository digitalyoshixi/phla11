A gut feeling of what is right and wrong. It is not necessarily backed by reasoning.
It is how we understand [[Moral Knowledge]].

# Evidences
### Direct Evidence
"It seems wrong to harm the innocents"
### Indirect Evidence
Intuition supports broader moral principles like:
- [[Justice]]
- [[Equality]]
