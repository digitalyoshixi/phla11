We can rationally justify and give reasons for [[Moral Facts]]. These reasons could be:
- Moral requirements/obligations
- Moral virtues
- Morally good outcomes
# Contrast
Arbitrary rules like the rules of chess or monopoly. These are hard to justify to because they were probably made with no reason in the first place.
# Reason <-> Obligation Connections
### Reasons Internalism
The idea that there is a connection between moral obligations and the existance of reasons.
##### Reason Creation
Reason can either be created by;
- Itself
- The recognition of a requirement * (The most widely accepted reason)
- The presence of an unrecognized requirement
### Reasons Externalism
There is no requirement to have a reason to act out moral obligations
# Obligation Application / Reason Intensity
- Modern internalism allows any reason to be justification for obligation. This can lead to irrational decisions where the reason is against the obligation, but 'leads' to it anyways.
- New internalism now relies on sufficient reason to justify doing the act, so it is always rationally permissable.
In the case of a madman ordering you to do something, you may see there is no reason for you to do it. Since,, there is no reason, there is no obligation.
For [[Objective Morality]] to exist, the reasons for the obligation must apply to you. You must have some justification for doing what morality asks of us.
