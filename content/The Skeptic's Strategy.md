1. Identify some feature, call it $F$ of objective morality if it exists
2. Argue that nothing has that feature $F$
3. Therefore, morality is nothing 
# Feature Incompatibility
1. Identify some features, $F,G,H, \dots$
2. Argue that nothing can exist with all features $F,G,H$ simultaneously. The various features are jointly incompatible
