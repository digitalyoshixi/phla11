A subdomain of [[Moral Realism]] that believes [[Moral Facts]] come from non-natural sources.
# Non-Natural Facts
Each moral fact has an:
- Action (Object, State of affairs)
- Moral property (Good, Bad, Just, Permissible, Valuable)
Non-naturalists argue that the action can be natural (i.e involving natural objects) but the moral property is non-natural.
We can say certain natural actions are forbidden like stepping on the cracks of the sidewalk.
# Supporting Arguments
### Mathematics
Mathematics are to challenge naturalism. They are not facts grounded in the real world.
These are abstract facts. These are not empirical facts, these are logical facts.
Because mathematical truths don't depend on the natural world, they are not natural facts.
### Divine
Facts about non-natural beings like God are inherently non-natural moral facts.
