The only [[Moral Facts|Moral Fact]] that they believe is true is that "God Does not Exist".
They view all other [[Moral Facts]] as false (even those negating each other).
- "God is weak"
- "God is strong"
These two opposite facts are equally as wrong to the atheist.

Atheists do, deny all positive moral facts (facts about the existence of some concept).
