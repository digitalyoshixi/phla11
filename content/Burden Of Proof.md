The party that must attempt to prove their argument. If they fail, then the opposite side wins by default.
In a legal proceeding, the burden of proof is on the [[Prosecution]].
If a prosecutor does not make the case, then the defense wins.
The presumption is that defense is innocent, the prosecution must assert they are guilty. This is burden of proof.
# Burden Of Proof Responsibility
From highest precedence to lowest precedence, The responsibility belongs to:
1. The one who makes the claim
2. The claim that does not follow status quo (See [[Sagan Standard]])
3. The [[Facts Polarity|Positive Claim]] that follows [[Occam's Razor]] 
# Examples
# Flat vs Round Earth
Where does the burden of proof lie on those who assert that the earth is round or those who assert it is flat?
You can think of it like positive and negative claims: One believes the earth is flat, one does not believe the earth is flat (they could be agnostic). The burden of proof is on the one that wants to make a [[Facts Polarity|Positive Facts]]. (Refer to [[Occam's Razor]])
# [[Moral Realism]] vs [[Moral Nihilism]]
The [[Moral Realism|Realist]] has the burden of proof
# Burden Of Proof for Facts
The burden of proof for facts depends on the fact that does **not** adhere to [[Occam's Razor]] (the more complex claim)
