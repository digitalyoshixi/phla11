Do [[Moral Facts]] require knowledge inaccessible to us?
Furthermore, does a lack of knowledge of these [[Moral Facts]] result in immorality?
**In other words, can morality be learned?**
# List Of Morality
There could be a system of rules mapping each action to a moral status of:
- Forbidden
- Required
- Permissible
This [[Action-Guiding]] list must be learned, and since we don't know it, we may all be immoral in some aspects.
If moral facts must be learned, than morality cannot be [[Action-Guiding]]
### Implementations
The system of moral rules will all be built off a foundation. This foundation could be based off:
- [[God's Will]]
- [[Social Contract]]
- [[Utilitarianism]]
# Extent of Knowledge
### 6th Sense
Similar to how one can understand language and not know the deeper structure and rules of language, ethics can also be inately understood without prior understanding of its rules.
Ethics is like a 6th sense
### [[Sense Modality]] & [[Empi]
Our knowledge of what is right or wrong is based off [[Intuition]]. It yields the appearance of rightness/wrongness
### General Principles
All we know are general principles, and all our moral decisions build off these general principles.
These principles can include:
- It is wrong to harm the innocent
- We should aid those in need
This is a limited capacity of knowledge, and very frequently these principles will conflict with each other in [[Moral Dilemma|Moral Dilemmas]] where we cannot be certain of any action.
