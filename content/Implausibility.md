If there is an argument that has an implausible conclusion $\neg Q$, but perfectly valid premises $A,B,C$, then you must weigh which one you think is more true:
- Your initial assumed conclusion $Q$
- The least-true premise - lets say $A$
You can also reject the premise-compatibility of several premises stating $A$ and $B$ are not compatible, but true in their separate sense.
