A branch of [[Moral Nihilism]] (There is no such thing as moral right and wrong).
We should change how we talk about moral language as to not make assertions.
When we engage in moral talk, we engage in fiction.
# Revisionist Nihilist
Moral language is intended to make [[Statements]],
but all of these claims are false.
But, because moral language is already very embedded in our way of speaking, maybe it can do another job.
Maybe, they can be used instead as [[Commands]] or [[Reaction]].
"Killing is wrong" can then be interpreted as these things rather than [[Statements]].
