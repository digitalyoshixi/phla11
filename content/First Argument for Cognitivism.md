# Argument against [[Non-Cognitivism]]
### Premises
1. Moral [[Reaction]] presupposes that there is a logical belief about a moral status/act
2. Moral claims are not truth-apt, so there are no claims at all, meaning there is nothing to believe
### Conclusion
Thus, there are no moral beliefs to base ones approval/disapproval of. The way [[Non-Cognitivism|Non-Cognitivists]] use [[Moral Language]] must change.
