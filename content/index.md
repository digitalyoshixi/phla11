# Ethics
The fact that we argue in ethical discussions predisposes that there is a right answer and that we reach the right answer. 
We argue that there are [[Moral Realism|Moral Truths]] and that [[Moral Relativism]] does not exist.
# Concepts

- [[Moral Relativism]]

# Questions
- Why does the atheist deny all facts? Do they deny facts that have nothing to do with god aswell?

- What does a positive first order moral fact mean?
