# Argument
### Premises
1. When you express a moral judgement, its necessarily connected with a motivational state (disproval, disgust, etc)
2. No claims are connected with a motivational state
### Conclusion
Therefore, when you express a moral judgement, you don't express a claim
# Alternate Argument
There is a necessary connection between thinking something wrong
and being at least somewhat motivated to avoid doing it. But the cognitivist
cannot explain that connection. So cognitivism is false
# Counterargument
Provide a moral statement that has no motivation.
Example:
"It is morally wrong to kill, but I don't care". Hitmen may believe in morality, but they genuinely don't care. (See [[Amoralism]])
