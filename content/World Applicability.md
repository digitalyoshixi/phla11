# Truth Types
### Necessary Truth
The idea that absolute truths apply to all possible worlds.
Examples of this include:
- Mathematics
### Contingent Truth
Truths that only apply to a single world.
Examples include:
- Physics
# Contingency Unavoidability
Contingency will be valid for moral actions.
Certain moral actions caused by physical properties like "giving someone cyanide" may be morally wrong in our world, but in a world where cyanide loses its harmful properties, there will be nothing wrong with that action.
However, contingency is not valid for [[Fundamental Moral Principles]]
