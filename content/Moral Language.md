# Moral Language
Best to associate language with truth.
Example: AND. I am holding a clicker and giving a thumbs up. You understand what it means for the sentence to be true.
since. we can use AND in morally language, this means that moral statements can have truth values.
# Rude != Morally Wrong
Locate different forms of approval/disapproval for [[Etiquette]] and [[Morality]].
# Moral Disagreement = Factual
It looks like moral disagreement is super meaningful like facts are.
Facts about taste, seem not very meaningful.
