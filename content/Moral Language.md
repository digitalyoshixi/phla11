# Importance
### Expresses How Other People act
We care deeply about how other people act.
Thus, we need a way to communicate approval/disapproval.
# Aspects
### Logical Language
Best to associate language with truth.
Example: AND. I am holding a clicker and giving a thumbs up. You understand what it means for the sentence to be true.
since. we can use AND in morally language, this means that moral statements can have truth values.
### Deeply Meaningful Moral Vocabulary
Moral disagreements are more meaningful then disputes about the best cream flavour.
As such, we have special moral vocabulary:
- Right
- Wrong
- Good
- Bad
- Forbidden
- Permissible
- [[Morally Required|Required]]
### Non-Verbal Claim ([[Non-Cognitivism]])
Moral language is meant to express your beliefs without verbally saying: "I believe such and such".
When you say "killing is wrong", you are making an non-verbal claim about your attitudes towards killing - namely that you dislike it.
### Imperative Element ([[Non-Cognitivism]])
When you utter moral claims, you express that people should follow that moral fact.
For example:
- "Killing is wrong" is the same as issuing the imperative "Don't kill!"
