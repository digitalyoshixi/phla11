The view that [[First Order Morality]] sentences are **not** [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]
Specifically, it is saying that [[Moral Statements]] cannot themselves be interpreted as [[Moral Statements]], but rather they are similar to [[Questions]] and [[Commands]].
Thereby, they prove that there are no [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]] [[Proposition|Propositions]] at all, and therefore nothing can be considered [[Knowledge]].

The only true statement that non-cognitivists believe in is the [[Moral Realism|Second Order Morality]] claim that no [[Moral Facts]] are [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]. 
# Support For Non-Cognitivism
*It is wrong to kill* means the same as *Don't Kill*.
Non-cognitivists say that the surface grammar does not make the actual [[Proposition]]

This mismatch is what non-cognitivists spend most their time proving - proving that a statement actually means another thing.

# Theses
### Negative Thesis
Moral sentences are not truth-apt
### Positive Thesis
Moral sentences express attitudes or commands
- Realist can accept the positive thesis. It is the negative thesis that is the point of disagreement
- The non-cognitivist requires the positive thesis because they owe us [[Moral Language]]
##### Cognitivism
When you assert the moral statement, what you mean is that the statement has a moral propety
