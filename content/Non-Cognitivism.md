The view that [[First Order Morality]] sentences are **not** [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]
Specifically, it is saying that [[Moral Statements]] cannot themselves be interpreted as [[Proposition]], but rather they are similar to [[Questions]] and [[Commands]].
Thereby, they prove that there are no [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]] [[Proposition|Propositions]] at all, and therefore nothing can be considered [[Knowledge]].

Non-cognitivists say that the surface grammar does not make the actual [[Proposition]]

This mismatch is what non-cognitivists spend most their time proving - proving that a statement actually means another thing.
