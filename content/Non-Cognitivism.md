The view that [[First Order Morality]] sentences are **not** [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]
Specifically, it is saying that statements cannot be truth apt, as we know that [[Questions]] and [[Commands]] are already not truth-apt.

# Support For Non-Cognitivism
*It is wrong to kill* means the same as *Don't Kill*.
Non-cognitivists say that the surface grammar does not make the actual statement.
This mismatch is what non-cognitivists spend most their time proving - proving that a statement actually means another thing.
For all [[First Order Morality]] claims, they can all be interpreted as [[Commands]].
