The view that [[First Order Morality]] sentences are **not** [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]
Specifically, it is saying that [[Statements]] cannot themselves be interpreted as [[Statements]], but rather they are similar to [[Questions]] and [[Commands]].
Every sentence is used to express & reveal an attitude.
Thereby, they prove that there are no [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]] [[Proposition|Propositions]] at all, and therefore nothing can be considered [[Knowledge]].
The point of [[Moral Language]] is to then non-verbally express your attitudes.

The only true statement that non-cognitivists believe in is the [[Moral Realism|Second Order Morality]] claim that no [[Moral Facts]] are [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]. 
# Support For Non-Cognitivism
*It is wrong to kill* means the same as *Don't Kill*.
Non-cognitivists say that the surface grammar does not make the actual [[Proposition]]

This mismatch is what non-cognitivists spend most their time proving - proving that a statement actually means another thing.
