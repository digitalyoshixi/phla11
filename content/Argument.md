1. A conclusion $Q$
2. Premises supporting the conclusion

All arguments can have this form:
- $A$
- $B$
- $C$
- ...
- Therefore  $Q$
# Flawed Argument
An argument like "EARTH IS FLAT, EARTH IS FLAT, EARTH IS FLAT", is not an argument because it does not have premises.
# Argument Choice
You can either:
- Accept the conclusion (You can be so confident in the conclusion that you don't pay heed to the premises)
- Reject the premises (You can't reject the conclusion without rejecting the premises)
# Example Argument
$Q:$ USC will lose the big-ten game
- $A:$ The Michigan defense will be stout again
- $B:$ The game is played in the big house
- $C:$ (implicitly if $A$ and $B$ then $Q$)
- Therefore $Q:$ USC will lose
