All arguments have two parts.
1. A conclusion $Q$
2. Premises supporting the conclusion

All arguments can have this form:
- $A$
- $B$
- $C$
- ...
- Therefore  $Q$
# Flawed Argument
An argument like "EARTH IS FLAT, EARTH IS FLAT, EARTH IS FLAT", is not an argument because it does not have premises.
# Argument Choice
You can either:
- Accept the conclusion
- Reject the premises (You can't reject the conclusion without rejecting the premises)
