# Theses
### Positive Thesis
The non-cognitivist requires the positive thesis because they owe us [[Moral Language]]
Moral sentences express attitudes or commands
When you assert a moral statement, what you imply is a expression of [[Reaction]] or expression of a [[Commands]].
E.g:
- Killing is wrong. Actually is a command "Boo, killing, booo, yuck!"
### Negative Thesis
Moral sentences are not truth-apt
**Realist can accept the positive thesis (moral statements can express 2+ ideas at the same time). It is the negative thesis that is the point of disagreement**
