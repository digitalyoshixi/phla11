# Theses
### Negative Thesis
Moral sentences are not truth-apt
### Positive Thesis
Moral sentences express attitudes or commands
- Realist can accept the positive thesis. It is the negative thesis that is the point of disagreement
- The non-cognitivist requires the positive thesis because they owe us [[Moral Language]]
##### Cognitivism
When you assert the moral statement, what you mean is that the statement has a moral property.
E.g:
- Killing is wrong. Has the property/quality of being wrong
- Grass is green. Has the property/quality of being green
### Non-Cognitivism
When you assert a moral statement, what you actually imply is a expression of [[Reaction]] or expression of a [[Commands]].
E.g:
- Killing is wrong. Actually is a command "Boo, killing, booo, yuck!"
