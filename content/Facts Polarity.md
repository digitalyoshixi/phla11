Moral nihilists deny all positive first order moral claims.
These are claims that have total polarity that is positive.
For example:
- Killing is good (Positive)
- Killing is **not** good(Negative)
- The statement Killing is good is **false** (Negative)
- The statement 'Killing is **not** good' is **false** (Positive)
A fact that doesn't have any negative terms in it will be positive. 
This is to prevent contradictions and redundant facts
