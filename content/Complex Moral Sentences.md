Sentences that are not [[Atomic Sentences]].
These are ones that express more than one idea.
For example:
- "If white lies are wrong, then it is wrong to tell one to your roommate"
# Explanations
### [[Cognitivism]]
You can build a logical relationship between them the statements.
For the white lies example, I can build:
"White lies are wrong" $\Rightarrow$ "Wrong to tell a white lie to roommate".
Each term can be evaluated as true or false(See [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]). Then each sentence can be evaluated accordingly.
### [[Non-Cognitivism]]
