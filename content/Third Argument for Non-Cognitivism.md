# Argument
### Premises
1. Cognitivists believe that [[Moral Facts]] entail motivation without further facts. Beliefs themselves, are the motivation
2. Attitudes are themselves, inherently motivating
### Conclusion
There is little distinction between moral statements and attitudes, so we can conclude that moral statements are likely reporting attitudes themselves.
