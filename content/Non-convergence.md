We will never agree on [[Truth]].
[[Moral Disagreement]] is inevitable.
# Ideal State For Convergence
1. All beings are perfectly rational
2. All individuals are given full knowledge
3. All individuals can recognize bias and correct it
4. Given unlimited time to think
5. All arguments equally weighted
6. 
# Argument
1. Domains that allow for discovering facts but not the convergence of those facts implies there there are no facts about that domain
2. In the domain of ethics, we can never reach convergence
Therefore, there are no moral facts
# Counterargument
### Science Also Has Non-convergence
We cannot converge on all scientific inquiries.
We cannot reasonably know what happened before the [[Big Bang]]
### We Are Not At the ideal state for convergences
We do not have the technology or fair social circumstances to allow for convergence.
