We will never agree on [[Truth]].
[[Moral Disagreement]] is inevitable.
# Argument
1. A domain that allows for discovering facts but does not allow for convergence on facts means its likely that there are no facts about that domain
2. In the domain of ethics, we can never reach convergence
Therefore, there are no moral facts
# Counterargument
### Science Also Has Non-convergence
We cannot converge on all scientific inquiries.
We cannot reasonably know what happened before the [[Big Bang]]
