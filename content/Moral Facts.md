If moral claims can be proven true, (as they are [[Truth-Aptness|Truth Apt]]), then these claims can either be true or false.
Thus, answers to these moral facts will either be correct, or mistaken.
So, it is possible to say something false about morality.

Moral facts are as pertinent as physical facts like pain. If a person is in pain, and you say they are not. You are simply mistaken.
# Error Constitution
### Knowledge of self, Unknowing of others
We assume that each person's [[Conscience]] is always right **only in regard to their own obligations**.
They can only be mistaken about what others ought to do.
# Moral Statements
A moral statement will:
- Attempt to describe these facts
- Assert the existence of facts
- If the facts are true, the statement is true
