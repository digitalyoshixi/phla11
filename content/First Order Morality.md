What we should do.
What is morally right or wrong
Example:
- Is killing in self defense wrong?
- Is spanking children wrong?
- Is taxing higher income bracket immoral
These arguments are all based off the previous assumption that there is a right answer.
# Key Point
The disagreement between parties is different from a [[Moral Realism]] disagreement between those who believe in objective morality and those who don't.
# Moral Arguments
The presupposition shared is not the same as it would be in a friendly disagreement (GOO LEAFS, BOO LEAFS!). 
It is expected that there is a robust argument and objective right answer.
