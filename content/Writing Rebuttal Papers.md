How do non-cognitivists make sense of moral arguments?
How do we make sense of believing things because it is true
##### Possible Reponses
- Moral arguments are just rhetoric
- They make us want to feel things
### 3
##### Sentence
So if we accept noncognitivism, won’t we need to hold that at a certain point in any
moral “argument,” what passes for the giving of good reasons will inevitably be
nothing more than verbal posturing and psychological manipulation? That rational
argument about fundamental moral questions must actually be impossible? That
seems a rather disappointing conclusion to reach. (In contrast, the cognitivist can
insist that even for basic moral issues the question is always whether a given moral
claim is true, and there is no reason to assume that such questions are beyond our
rational grasp. (pp.99-100)
##### Meaning
All moral arguments are a form of social manipulation
##### Possible Responses
- It is psychological manipulation, but its a good thing. Because when we inspire somebody to do things, we make a better society

##### Sentence
But be that all as it may, there is a second explanation of moral disagree- ment
available to the moral realist, one that seems available even when we are
discussing disagreements at the fully underlying (nonderivative) level. This second
explanation starts with the observation that we seem to get more disagreement
(even in fields where a realist stance seems uncontroversial) when the particular
questions being debated speak to our self-conceptions or are relevant to nontrivial
human interests. Thus, to take just a few familiar examples, questions about IQ and race, the impact of potential tax cuts on the economy, the causes of climate change, the long-term effects of social welfare programs, and whether one’s sex makes a genetic difference to one’s psychology, are all subjects of deep and emotional debates. In all of these cases, getting straight on the facts here may ultimately make a difference to how we think of ourselves, how people will be treated, how we will need to behave, and who gets what. With so much at stake, perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that disagreements emerge here—despite these being factual questions—at a greater rate than they do elsewhere. (pp.122-3)
