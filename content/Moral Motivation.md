There is a connection between the judging of a [[Morally Required]] task and the motivation to actually do it. 
There could always be selfishness or lack of interest that prevents these tasks from being motivating
It is often said that [[Moral Facts]] are this motivation, and for moral facts to exist, they **need to motivate us**.
# Motivation <-> Morality Connection

There is a connection between morality and motivation
##### Motives Creation
Motives can either be created by;
- Itself
- The recognition of a requirement
- The presence of an unrecognized requirement
### Motive Externalism
There is no connection between morality and motivaiton
# Obligation Application / Motivation Intensity
### Bold Requirement
The motivation to do the obligation must be stronger than the competing motivations.
### Modest Requirement
There needs to be *some* motivational force to allow for action
### No Correlation
- Motivation could exist without obligation existing
