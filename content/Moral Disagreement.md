A disagreement is when there are two conflicting moral actions.
So there seems to be widespread moral disagreement, it seems impossible to decide.
It does not seem there is any clear answer to these disagreements.
**The reason why there is widespread moral disagreement, is that there is no anchor to validate these moral actions**
There mere presence of disagreement is enough to cast doubt on moral facts
# Skeptic's Argument
1. Disagreements are widespread in ethics (More widespread then disagreements in science)
2. When there is widespread disagreement about a topic, it is likely that there are no [[Argument|Substantive Truths]] about the topic
3. Therefore, there are no substantive facts about ethics, i.e moral nihilism is true
### Skeptics Explanation
##### Nihilism
1. We believe there are moral facts
2. We end up disagreeing because there are no moral facts
##### Realist & Nihilist Rebuttals
The realist first asks:
- Why do we assume there are moral facts?
- What leads us to differing moral beliefs?
The nihilist replies with [[Psychology|Psychological]] reasons.
The realist can also cite [[Psychology]]. So, the nihilists explanation isn't any better than the realist.
##### Non-Cognitivism
##### Realist & Non-cognitivist Rebuttals
No moral claims, how did we end up with disagreement in the first place? Why do we have different attitudes?
If all our claims are feelings, then why do we diverge in feelings?
# Counterarguments
### Science (Not rejecting any premise)
Fields like science, where there are scientific facts also have disagreements.
This does not imply that there are no scientific facts.
### Widespread Agreements (Premise 1)
Sometimes there is just one moral factor rather than two equally powerful moral actions that pull against each other.
**There are certain moral actions that are almost unanimously believe** like:
- It is immoral to torture the innocent
We implicitly rely on these facts everyday.
There are moral disagreements here as well, but the moral disputes that we tend to allocate more attention to are ones that we just happen to focus on.
### Non-Intelligible Scope (Premise 1)
There is no scope to this point, no threshold on how many people disputing
### Skeptics Inherit Belief In Facts (Premise 2)
Widespread disbelief/belief does not constitute belief in **metaethical** facts.
Nihilists and non-cognitivists both believe in the metaethical facts (no fact being true or no fact being truth-apt).
### Likely that there are no facts (Premise 2)
A discussion of [[Epistimology]].
We can not see/hear of feel the wrongness of torture, 
Likewise, none of us can see/hear/feel the laws of mathematics.
But, there is no widespread disagreement about mathematics.

The reason is why is ethics is urgent and we have to decide the answer to these moral questions ourselves rather than math, which is not as urgent to find facts in.

Likewise, there is widespread disagreement in [[Causality]]. But nobody wants to doubt causation exists.

But, moral nihilism/non-cognitivism is self-refuting when it comes to these because the position depends on facts
### Widespread Disagreement about Widespread Disagreement (Premise 2)
If we let the principle apply to itself, then the fact that there is widespread disagreement can be questioned aswell.
If democratic opinion can validate a fact, then democratic rejection of democratic rejection itself can mean there is no correlation of democracy to truth aswell.
# Realist Explanation of Disagreement
Most moral disagreements are actually about:
### Non-Moral facts
- [[Tax the Rich]] vs [[Trickle-down Economics]]. They just disagree about the economy
### Deep Moral Facts (Moral Facts Grounded in [[Bias]])
- Motivated beliefs like [[Vegetarianism]], [[Equality]] come from personal biases
- You have motivation to believe in a fact, because it will benefit you. You are biased to certain sides
