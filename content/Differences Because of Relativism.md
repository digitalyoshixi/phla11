A argument to prove [[Moral Relativism]] by saying that the best explanation for differences in beliefs is because of different [[Moral Code]].

These obligations can be formed because of:
- [[God's Will]]
- Fundamental differences in circumstances. [[Laws of Nature]] may dictate us to favor certain things more
