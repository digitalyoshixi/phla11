A branch of [[Non-Reductionism|Simple Realism]] based off the counterargument:
1. Every [[Moral Facts|Moral Fact]] can either have or not have a reason.
2. Because, a reason is not required, the property of having a reason is a [[Basic Property|Irreducible Property]]
3. Since, reason is not itself a non-moral property, reductionism fails
However, the counterargument is: **Reasons can also be non-moral**, thereby allowing [[Reductionism]] to survive.

Thus, Normative Realism has the distinction of being a branch of [[Reductionism]] rather than [[Non-Reductionism|Simple Realism]].
