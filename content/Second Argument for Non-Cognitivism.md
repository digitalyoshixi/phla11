# Argument
### Premises
1. Accepting a moral claim involves the giving/accepting of a [[Commands|Command]]
3. One can assert the existence of something without offering [[Commands]]
### Conclusion
Cognitivism allows for making moral claims without commands. This is [[Absurd]]
# Counterargument
### Rejecting Premise 1
Deny that there is a connection between believing claims and accepting commands.
One can think an act wrong, but not issue the imperative to back it up.
- "Murder is wrong, but I dont care! Kill frank!". It knows an act is wrong, but issues a command that is not directly following the moral action
### Rejecting Premise 2
Argue that whenever you believe a moral claim, you are also believing the derivative imperative claims aswell.
- I believe that murder is wrong, thus I believe the command "Don't kill" is also a valid command
