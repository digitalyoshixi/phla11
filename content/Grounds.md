What it is that constitutes [[Concept Properties]].
Some [[Moral Facts]] are [[Complex Property|Complex]] and depend on other [[Basic Property|Basic]] [[Moral Facts]].
For example:
- Being wrong (complex) is a result of going against [[God's Will]] (basic)
- Being wrong (complex) is a lack of social [[Etiquette]] (basic)

Facts that have grounds are [[Reductionism|Reducible]]. 
# Mind Dependence
Moral facts are grounded in the reactions or attitudes of the moral action (See [[Action Contents]]). They are mind-dependent.
[[Fundamental Moral Principles]] therefore, must be mind independent, and have nothing to do with what the mind thinks or believes. They must be like the laws of physics which have nothing essential to do with what we like or dislike.
### Mind Dependence Example
Facts about pleasure are facts about the experiences of minds. 
Facts about virtue are facts about the character traits of minds.
To remain mind-independent, you **must not reduce the principle to facts about the mind at all**.
### Certain Theories are Also Mind Dependent
The rules of English are not concerned with the reaction of its users. But, the reactions of the users is what allows English to change.
The dissatisfaction of previous grammar norms allowed Anglo-Saxon English to change to how it is now.
