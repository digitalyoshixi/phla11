The idea that [[Fundamental Moral Principles]] vary in certain groups and certain periods.
There is no single universally valid moral code.
The relativist is a [[Moral Realism|Realist]], they just allow a mass variation of truth.
# Optional Incompatibilities
Moral relativism may be incompatible with [[Objective Morality]] - More specifically [[Metaphysical Necessity]] and [[Moral Relativism|Moral Universality]] depending on your [[Morality Job Description]].
# Sides
### Absolutists
Moral truths apply for everyone across societies, cultures and time
### Relativists
Moral truths do not hold for true for all groups and periods of time
# Contrast
The rules of etiquette; derivatives of [[Fundamental Moral Principles]]
Example:
- [[Etiquette]]: Slavery was socially accepted, but we say it is morally unacceptable
- Derivative moral facts: In promises. We are not obliged to see our professor's daughter's baseball game because we did not make a promise. The fundamental moral principle is "keep your promises".
- Fashion
# Views
### Normative View
The individual ought to conform to the moral code of their society
##### Incompatibility With [[Non-Cognitivism]]
There must be first an imperative 'follow your societies moral codes even if that code is really bad' issued to every rational being first.
It does not seem like any tolerance-loving person would issue this command - because they would know it may lead to unintended consequences.
Thus it seems unreasonable
##### Incompatibility with [[Constructivism]]
The constructivist doesn't have to say that the facts in the [[Moral Code]] are the mind-dependent facts that society sees is acceptable.
- It could actually be that the valid moral code is made by [[God's Will]]
- The valid moral code could be made by [[Mind Dependence|Mind Dependent]] facts created by an entirely different society, to impose on the current society
- It could be a valid moral code made by the same members of the society in [[Ideal State|Ideal Circumstances]], but that code does not necessarily align with what the society sees as acceptible now
##### Incompatible with [[Moral Motivation|Motive Internalism]]
[[Moral Code]] needs to motivate you to act in alignment of it.
- If you are motivated by it, you need not accept the [[Moral Code]]
- You might not have that motivation that you recognise at this moment. You might develop those motivations in the future. So the current [[Moral Code]] does not fit you
### Descriptive View
Different societies accept different [[Moral Code|Moral codes]]
##### Compatibility With [[Non-Cognitivism]]
If we see moral claims as imperatives, then the society's moral code will apply to us as commands. They will address us directly.
There is no way a command is absolute. Hence, it is compatible with relativism
##### Incompatibility With Realism
We cannot prove that different groups believe in different [[Fundamental Moral Principles]].

# Issues With Relativism
### Hidden Relativization
Moral laws appear to be universal, but are implicity relativized.
For example: "The podium is to the right". But my left is not your right.
##### Problem of No Meaning
If implicit relativization is true, then this imples that no society can ever be mistaken about the moral code. This is very similar to the command-issuing in [[Non-Cognitivism]]. This means that moral disagreement actually talks past eachother. Moral progress then seems impossible.
Then moral progress is only either:
- Rhetoric
- Deceptive
### Can Be Mistaken for [[Fundamental Moral Principles]] Derivative Arguments
Moral beliefs in a culture could be based off what is best for the culture based off empirical data.
For example, capital punishment being ethical in one culture to deter crime vs it being unethical in another because it doesn't deter crime.
This could simply be an argument about the non-moral principle it was based on.

### All Relativists Must Accept The Absolute Truth to Follow Their Societies Commands
For relativism to be true, then no person should be able to not follow the truths of the society.
Each relativist must accept this one absolute truth.
### Likely to Have Same Fundamental Moral Codes
Facts about the human condition seems to be the same in most societies so it appears that most societies may be that the same fundamental moral code is shared between all societies.
Then, if all societies have the same moral code, there is no relativism.
