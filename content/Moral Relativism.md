The idea that a certain action and behavior is ok for certain groups, but not ok for other groups.
# Sides
### Absolutists
Moral truths apply for everyone across societies, cultures and time
### Relativists
Moral truths do not hold for true for all groups and periods of time
# Contrast
The rules of etiquette; derivatives of [[Fundamental Moral Principles]]
Example:
- [[Etiquette]]: Slavery was socially accepted, but we say it is morally unacceptable
- Derivative moral facts: In promises. We are not obliged to see our professor's daughter's baseball game because we did not make a promise. The fundamental moral principle is "keep your promises".
