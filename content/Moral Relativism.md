The idea that a certain action and behavior is ok for certain groups, but not ok for other groups.
There is no single universally valid moral code.
The relativist is a [[Moral Realism|Realist]], they just allow a mass variation of truth.
Moral relativism is incompatible with [[Objective Morality]] - More specifically [[Metaphysical Necessity]].
# Sides
### Absolutists
Moral truths apply for everyone across societies, cultures and time
### Relativists
Moral truths do not hold for true for all groups and periods of time
# Contrast
The rules of etiquette; derivatives of [[Fundamental Moral Principles]]
Example:
- [[Etiquette]]: Slavery was socially accepted, but we say it is morally unacceptable
- Derivative moral facts: In promises. We are not obliged to see our professor's daughter's baseball game because we did not make a promise. The fundamental moral principle is "keep your promises".

# Issues With Relativism
### No Absolute Truths
Bad implication that there are absolutely no truths.
It means that it can not be 100% true that killing people is wrong.
Now, no culture can ever be mistaken about morality
### Hidden Relativization
Moral laws appear to be universal, but are implicity relativized.
For example: "The podium is to the right". But my left is not your right.
##### Problem of No Meaning
If implicit relativization is true, then this imples that moral disagreement actually talks past eachother. Moral progress then seems impossible.
Then moral progress is only either:
- Rhetoric
- Deceptive
