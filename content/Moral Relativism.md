The idea that [[Fundamental Moral Principles]] vary in certain groups and certain periods.
There is no single universally valid moral code.
The relativist is a [[Moral Realism|Realist]], they just allow a mass variation of truth.
# Optional Incompatibilities
Moral relativism may be incompatible with [[Objective Morality]] - More specifically [[Metaphysical Necessity]] and [[Moral Relativism|Moral Universality]] depending on your [[Morality Job Description]].
# Sides
### Absolutists
Moral truths apply for everyone across societies, cultures and time
### Relativists
Moral truths do not hold for true for all groups and periods of time
# Contrast
The rules of etiquette; derivatives of [[Fundamental Moral Principles]]
Example:
- [[Etiquette]]: Slavery was socially accepted, but we say it is morally unacceptable
- Derivative moral facts: In promises. We are not obliged to see our professor's daughter's baseball game because we did not make a promise. The fundamental moral principle is "keep your promises".

# Issues With Relativism
### Hidden Relativization
Moral laws appear to be universal, but are implicity relativized.
For example: "The podium is to the right". But my left is not your right.
##### Problem of No Meaning
If implicit relativization is true, then this imples that no society can ever be mistaken about the moral code. This means that moral disagreement actually talks past eachother. Moral progress then seems impossible.
Then moral progress is only either:
- Rhetoric
- Deceptive
### Can Be Mistaken for [[Fundamental Moral Principles]] Derivative Arguments
Moral beliefs in a culture could be based off what is best for the culture based off empirical data.
For example, capital punishment being ethical in one culture to deter crime vs it being unethical in another because it doesn't deter crime.
This could simply be an argument about the non-moral principle it was based on.

### All Relativists Must Accept The Absolute Truth to Follow Their Societies Commands
For relativism to be true, then no person should be able to not follow the truths of the society.
Each relativist must accept this one absolute truth.
