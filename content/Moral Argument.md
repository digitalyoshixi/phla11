The [[Argument]] involving [[Moral Facts]]
# Explanations
### [[Cognitivism]]
We attempt to sway those opposed by offering reasons to believe why our argument is true.
### [[Non-Cognitivism]]
We attempt to change the opponent's preferences.
This can be:
- Psychological manipulation
- Verbal posturing. Provide derivative preferences (Saying that it would benefit your goal $X$, if you favored $Y$ aswell)
